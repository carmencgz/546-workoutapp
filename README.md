Gym Tracker â€“ most straightforward
-	An app that allows you to track your workouts
-	Option to include what you did, how you felt, what music you listened to, what weights and machines you used, and a picture
Feedback:
-	Would need to focus on UI
-	Maybe export data to csv to be able to move it to another app
-	No external libraries used
